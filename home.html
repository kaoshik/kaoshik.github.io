<h5>two similar feelings</h5>
<i>November 13, 2023</i>
<p class="lead">
 (like many other things, this also came to me when i was walking)
 <br>
1. almost evening, and everyone is at home except your papa. he is not at home since the morning, he has taken the car and just isn't home. But then he came, i opened the gate and he parked the car inside, we took the brought things inside and there is stillness in the front of house. and there is heat, two types of heats. one is of the car, because it was used, the other is actually not heat but warmth due to the completeness of home.
<br>
2. there is a festival, say diwali. and you know, all the rituals, we did that. light up diyas, did proper pooja, then ate the tastiest of dinner. and then i go out, in front of house. that feeling. there are two blisses. one is that the great festival is celebrated even more greatly, and the other is due to the completeness of home. 
<br>
the list of all these similar feelings will be completed on the day - we have the power and pureness to tell someone how we feel.

<h5>Tootbrush</h5>
<i>July 13, 2023</i>
<p class="lead">
	Imagine a toothbrush named ‘K’. In a fully automatic factory he was made.
	Crisp, shiny and packed in a more shiny plastic cover. Manufacturers told
	him to advertise himself, if he wants to be picked. See. It’s very suffocating
	for K in that air tight plastic cover. Wonder what he thinks in alone or all
	time. He is a good toothbrush, soft, colorful, flexible, and with all the
	fanciness it is expected from a toothbrush. Now from factory, he was put
	inside a carton, don’t forget he is still packed in his own plastic. Many
	months passed, K was existing silently, though he did well always, that’s
	why he was put on display in one of the shop. And one evening, an owner came
	for him. K was happy though he can't show anyone or anyone wasn't even concerned
	about K’s happiness, except his owner. Morning. And K breathed fresh, he hadn't 
	done it since he was born. He wasn't sure if he could even breathe or not, but he did.
	As K has done a lot good, he was soft too soft. K was a toothbrush, unused, and unsure
	of his use. Some water washed K as if he was dirty. K thought for once that water
	could be dirty but he cannot be. Then a liquid paste was put on K’s hair, K found
	it tingling and even more tingling when its owner put him in her mouth. K’s purpose
	was completed or was it just started, at least K was happy. Door closed. K’s use was
	over for the day. It was darkness. Suffocating but a lot a lot less as it was earlier.
	K got used to this darkness. K’s thought were just of the morning, his owner’s hand
	touching him, lifting him up, waking him up from sleep. K’s sleep wasn't there. 
	He was too anxious, he couldn't sleep for a thought disturbs him- the thought of his
	owner coming in morning and not finding K awake to its glory, K’s sleep shouldn't be
	there if his owner has to feel fresh, he thought. Days passed. K’s happiness cruised,
	he was good, and he was doing its task to his best self. In this process, his hair was
	shedding, he became hard maybe from constant thoughts of its owner when he was alone
	in dark. In the times of his inactivity, he thinks whether his owner is seeing the
	difference in him. K is just waiting for that estranged touch of his owner which will
	make K sure of his uselessness and the sight in which some L is in his owner’s hand.<br>
 Imagine.

<h5>The idea of a short film</h5>
<i>Oct 31, 2023</i>
<p class="lead">
    Like all other stories, this one also came to me when I was walking. <br>
[START] <br>
The idea. I was made to believe that the idea of something is better than
that something. It’s not my original thought. I read it somewhere, I found it reasonably true. But to a point, it shouldn’t be the case, that you start living in your head. <br>
of a short film. Few days back, I was cleaning my room and found something and found something more. A very tightly packed glue like pink balloon which was years old. And my hard-disk. Now as that very tightly packed glue like pink balloon was old, so it got stuck to my hard-disk, it is like I have put a pink bubble gum on my hard-disk. Ideally I should have thrown that very tightly packed glue like pink balloon away and cleaned my hard-disk but, I didn’t. <br>
I thought I would make a short film with that very tightly packed glue like pink balloon and my hard-disk as lead characters. Now I should tell you the story of that never created short film. The story is simple, very simple and very pointless to a point. I would use my phone camera to shoot it. I will place my phone above my table using some books, so in frame would be just my beautiful brown table as seen from top. I will place my hard-disk precisely on the table, so that in phone camera it is clearly visible as a black rectangular hard-disk and to it stick is that very tightly packed glue like pink balloon. I will on the video in phone camera. I will move my clean hands slowly on the table and pick that hard-disk up slightly and very gently remove that very tightly packed glue like pink balloon and throw it out of the frame of the video. And then I will put my hard-disk back on the table. Then I will move my hands slowly on the table, but this time my hands will not be empty it will have a slightly wet cleaning cloth, and I will pick up my hard-disk again. And start cleaning it gently, to remove the pink traces from my hard-disk. It took some time to clean it. Finally its pure black. I  remove the now dirty cleaning cloth away from the video and gently put
 
my hard-disk back on my beautiful brown table. With this I will turn off the camera recording. <br>
[END] <br>
Some notes: <br>
1.	There won’t be any sound at all in the above mentioned short film. I will remove it completely by deleting the audio. <br>
2.	The title of this short film will be, “cleaning my hard-disk”. <br>
3.	At the end of this short film, in credits section, I want that very tightly packed glue like pink balloon and my hard-disk to be mentioned as the leads of this short film. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br> [POINTLESSNESS] <br>
Some more notes: <br>
1.	Once my mother in my absence threw that very tightly packed glue like pink balloon away. I became angry, and very hastily searched the garbage to pick it up. <br>
2.	In college, I liked a girl. And that very tightly packed glue like pink balloon which was then very much alive and was used in her birthday party. I picked it up and slowly it shrank to very minimal, which was easily storable. Surprisingly in my horoscope it is mentioned that I am a born collector of things and find it difficult to throw anything, thinking it will be useful in future.
<br> 
3.	I came back home, with it that balloon and slowly without my realization, it turned into a very tightly packed glue like pink balloon. <br>
4.	Obviously I lost contact with her, which I never was in. I forgot about her and that balloon. It wasn’t easy to forget. How not to think something? There is no way. You just can’t unlearn something. But what we can do is learn new things, fill your mind with more present, more peaceful things in order to put that old thing behind. In a way we try to make that thing unimportant, or priority-less. But it only happens in certain cases where you are fortunate. <br>
5.	I was fortunate. But in the process I came so ahead that I completely forgot about that balloon. Now it has to be thrown. It has to be put to a place where it belongs, where it will live happily. <br>
6.	So, before throwing I wanted to use that one last time to make this short film. <br>
7.	You will ask me the purpose of this short film, to which I will
answer. It’s a metaphor. Oh Metaphor. In the name of metaphor you can justify anything. I will do the same. The first metaphor is my hard-disk. Hard-disk as you know is a computer memory, a storing device which in the short film is a metaphor to my memory. Second in the line of this metaphorism is that very tightly packed glue like pink balloon. It was her. A symbol representing her presence in my life. And third and the most pointless of all the metaphors is the association of the two. My memory and her. In the short film, I clean my memory of the stains from her presence. And in the end I was able to achieve it. At what cost you may ask, to which I will say, that dirty insignificant cloth, who couldn’t make it even to the credits of this short film. However insignificant, it was required. Now to justify it. Let’s place a new metaphor here. The fourth and the last of them. This dirty cloth represents the time, my time in this very limited of life, which I passed, in that time I existed in the name of revamping myself, finding my true-self and many other life-less terms. <br>
Finally, I threw that off.

<h5>Birthday Wishes or lack of it</h5>
<i>Dec 01, 2022</i>
<p class="lead">
    "@Sparsh how's ur day going? Belated happy birthday!", 
    this was her wish on a GROUP CHAT on the DAY of the bday.
    You should greet properly. Or maybe the greeting is more than 
    just a greeting, its a token of care or importance. By greeting someone, you are admiting that that person is 
    important (this is definitely not true for everyone, but for someone who just doesn't distribute greetings like anything,
	who has a small circle, it is surely true). It is important to write about it, you get just a single day, on
    which you are special, you feel special, and even on that day you think about just that one greeting which wasn't there.
    It is wrong on my part, ideally I shouldn't think about it. But how is that possible, for my very little mind, I think
    it is impossible to not just think about it. You don't just say it aloud all day, but there's a tiny qoink inside you
    which asks, "why haven't she wished?, yet". Every year there is one such person, whose greeting is important for you, 
    atleast in your view, it is important and this one person will/should change over the years. I will wait very patiently for
    this change to happen.

<h5>Cancelled mumbai trip</h5>
<i>Nov 29, 2022</i>
<p class="lead">
    Ankur mumbai me kaam karta hai. Usne bola aaja ghumne dec 22 
    ke around, plan fit kiya maine. Mai to jabse convocation se aaya hu
    tabse kahi nahi gaya, mauka hi nahi mila. Socha, bohot ho gaya, chalte hai
    ghumne, plus dost bhi acha hi hai, maje aayege. Confirm krne ke liye bola use, 
    ek week se zyada ho gaya, koi response hi nhi aaya uska. Mai to itna excited tha, 
    ghar valo ko bhi bol diya tha ki karao prabandh jaane ka, ab to vo bhi kabhi kabhi chidha 
    dete hai. Unhe pehle se doubt tha, muje sure tha ki acha dost hai plus usne saamne
    se bulaya tha, aur bolra tha ki bas aane ki ticket karaio, ho sakta hai jyada time rukna pade.
    Fuck Up sa ho gaya na. Mai kya karu isme, meri side se thodi na koi flaw tha. Simple hai, kahi bando
    ke nhi hote ache dost chahe vo jitne bhi ache ho, meri to kundli vgera me bhi likha hai
    ki ache dost nahi banege, kahi sach to nhi hoti na ye baatein? Anyway, ho to rahi hai
    ab tak, aage ka pata nahi. Ek na curve hota hai mere saath friendship me, pehle to itna high
    ki bhai bas yahi dost hai, ki har jagha mil bhi raha hai, ye vo, fir kuch na kuch ho jata, 
    obviously ladai nhi, aaj kal friends kaha ladte hai, ladai hoti to atleast pata to chalta ki 
    reason kya hai, kya nhi, bina ladai ke to bas guess hi krte raho kya hua hai. Aur suno, 
    socha mumbai jaana hai to thoda fit ho jata hu, plan banaya kaafi strict sa, follow bhi kar hi raha
    hu kuch bhi karke par ab to jaana hi nahi. Haa, ab thodi na jauga, acha bhi nahi lagta, ye to chep
    vaali baat hojegi. CHEP, ye alag scene hai. Muje to har baar lagta hai ki saamne vala sochega chep hora hai,
    pata kaise chalta hai ki saamne vale ko lagega aisa ya nahi. Pata nahi, par decide huya hai, kiya hai ki
    nahi jaara ab. Plus ab na mann se utar gaya, aur surprisingly muje na aadat si ho gayi hai in cheejo ki.
    Kaafi galat baat hai, par ho gayi hai, kyuki saare friends aisa hi krte hai, sooner aur later sab karege.
    Busy jo ho jaate hai. Busy hai to fir rahe busy.
